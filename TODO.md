## TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to be completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

### Next Release

* Add to build process so that every published packaged is attempted to be built using bazel to
  ensure it's dependencies align.
