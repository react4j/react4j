React4j is a relatively new toolkit but there are some other resources and related projects.
This list will hopefully grap over time. Feel free to submit a pull request to add new projects
to this page.

* [arez](https://github.com/arez/arez) Arez is a simple, efficient and scalable state management library
  powered by a transparent functional reactive programming core. It is the state management library that
  has the best support in the react4j library.

* [react-widget](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-widget) The library provides a GWT widget that
  renders a React4j element. This project has been archived as there is no desire to continue supporting
  this architecture although it should still be possible.
* [react-windowportal](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-windowportal) The library provides a portal that
  renders into a Window. This project has been archived as the component was not completed to a high enough
  standard to make continuing support of the project a worthwhile investment.

### Sample Projects

There is also a few sample projects that you can look at to see how different types of applications can be
built using React4j.

* [react-drumploop](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-drumloop) A rewrite of the [hooks-drum-machine](https://github.com/kenwheeler/hooks-drum-machine)
  project presented as part of a talk. It was originally written in `react.js` using hooks and suspense. This
  was ported to react4j and continues to use the experimental suspense support and `react-cache`.
* [react-sithtracker](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-flux-challenge) An solution for the problem presented
  in the [flux challenge](https://github.com/staltz/flux-challenge) using Arez and React4j.
* [react-todomvc](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-todomvc) Several implementations of the [TodoMVC](todomvc.md)
  application rewritten using react4j and other supporting technologies.
