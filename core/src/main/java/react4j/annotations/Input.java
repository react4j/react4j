 * Annotation used to specify an abstract method that returns a prop.

 * <p>The method that is annotated with this annotation must also comply with the following constraints:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Must not be annotated with any other react annotation</li>
 * <li>Must have 0 parameters</li>
 * <li>Must return a value</li>
 * <li>Must be an abstract instance method</li>
 * <li>Must not throw exceptions</li>
 * <li>Must be accessible from the same package as the class annotated by {@link View}</li>
 * <li>
 *   Should not be public as not expected to be invoked outside the view. A warning will be generated but can
 *   be suppressed by the {@link SuppressWarnings} or {@link SuppressReact4jWarnings} annotations with a key
 *   "React4j:PublicMethod". This warning is also suppressed by the annotation processor if it is implementing
 *   an interface method.
 * </li>
